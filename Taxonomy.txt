The fennec fox was scientifically described as Canis zerda by Eberhardt Zimmermann in 1780.[3][4][2] In 1788, Johann Friedrich Gmelin gave the species the synonym of Canis cerdo with the type locality being the Sahara Desert.[5] A few years later, Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer assigned the name Viverra aurita to the species in 1793;[6] the type locality was Algeria. Subsequent synonyms include Fennecus arabicus by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest in 1804;[7] Megalotis cerda by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1811[8] which was based on earlier descriptions by Gmelin, and another synonym by Desmarest (Fennecus brucei) in 1820; the type locality was Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Sudan. In 1827, the species was given another synonym (Canis fennecus) by René Lesson whose work was largely based on the species scientific description in 1780.[9] In the 1840s, the species received synonyms by Pierre Boitard in 1842 (Vulpes denhamii)[10] and John Edward Gray in 1843 (Vulpes zuarensis).[11] The type localities of these were "interior of Africa" and Egypt, respectively. In 1978 Gordon Barclay Corbet renamed the species to Vulpes zerda,[12] its current scientific name.[2] It was originally assigned to the genus Canis, but following molecular analysis it was moved to Vulpes despite having some distinct morphological and behavioral traits.[13]

According to DNA evidence, the closest living relative to the fennec fox is the Blanford's fox. They are two of eight "desert fox" species, which is a group of Vulpes that share comparable ecologies. The other members include the corsac fox, pale fox, kit fox, Tibetan fox, Rüppell's fox and Cape fox. All eight species evolved to survive in desert environments, developing several traits such as sandy colored coats, large ears, pigmented eyes, and specialized kidneys.[14] The word fennec is derived from the Arabic word fanak which likely has Persian origins.[15]

The fennec fox is one of 13 extant Vulpes species and a member of the family Canidae.
