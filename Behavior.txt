Fennec foxes are primarily nocturnal, displaying heightened activity during the cooler nighttime hours.[23] This behaviour helps them escape the extreme Saharan heat and reduces water loss through panting.[24] A fennec fox digs its den in sand, either in open areas or places sheltered by plants with stable sand dunes. In compacted soils, dens are up to 120 m2 (1,300 sq ft) large, with up to 15 different entrances. In some cases, different families interconnect their dens, or locate them close together. In soft, looser sand, dens tend to be simpler with only one entrance leading to a single chamber.[17]

Captive individuals reside in family groups. Fennec foxes exhibit playful behavior, especially among younger individuals.
